Adding Font Hinting to Juce

Status: Complete
Result: Failed

The outlines returned from DirectWrite at the correct emSize are no different than the ones returned when using emSize of 1024.

"The geometry retrieved via GetGlyphRunOutline is never grid-fit. It is technically still 'hinted' (as all the hinting instructions are executed), but essentially at the font's em box size, rather than to a specific pixel resolution and em size. Grid-fitting to the nearest pixel/subpixel only applies to the raster modes."

By the looks of the old Juce Win32 font code, it appear they are getting technically 'hinted' fonts as well. GGO_UNHINTED is never used. There doesn't seem to be a way to specify emSize with GetGlyphOutline.
